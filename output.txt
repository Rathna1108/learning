by suprameatal (MacEwen') triangle (Fig. 1.12). The lat-
eral wall of the antrum is very thin at birth (about 2 mm)
and then increases in thickness at the rate of 1 mm per
year, till it is 12-15 mm in an adult. Also remember that
the supramastoid crest roughly corresponds to the floor
of the middle cranial fossa.

developed and their intervening septa are thin.

2. Diploetic: Mastoid consists of marrow spaces and a
few air cells.

3, Sclerotic or acellular: There are no cells or marrow spaces.

‘Aditus is an opening through which the attic communicates
with the antrum. The bony prominence of the horizontal
canal lies on its medial side, while the fossa incudis, into
which is attached the short process of incus, lies laterally.

With any type of mastoid pneumatization, antrum is
always present. In sclerotic mastoids, antrum is usually
small and the sigmoid sinus is anteposed.

Depending on the location, mastoid air cells are
divided into:

5. Perilabyrinthine cells (located above, below and behind
the labyrinth, some of them pass through the arch of

6. Peritubal cells (around the eustachian tube; along with
hypotympanic cells, they also communicate with the
petrous apex)

7. Tip cells (which are quite large and lie medial and lateral
to the digastric ridge in the tip of mastoid)

extend into the occipital bone)
